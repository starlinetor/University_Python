# University Python
All the code I have done for the Information Tecnologies course 2024/2025 first semester at Politecnico of Torino

# Bugs and errors
Even if i am confident that the solutions are all mostly correct bugs might be present, if you find any it would be very appreciated if you reported them

Report any bugs in the issue tab on github : https://github.com/starlinetor/University_Python/issues

# Language
All the code is written in english for personal preference

# Publish time
If the lab is already published monday morning I will do all the problems I can between 8:30 and 11:00. But I can't promise this will always be the case

# Note
I might not solve problems in the intended way and I might add more functionalities, I usually try to keep my code readable but is up to you to understand it
